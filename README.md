# Mission to Mars

## Project Overview
A web-scraping project where we gather images of Mars from a NASA webpage and collect it on our own site. 

This involved scraping webpages to locate specific images and text-based data, connecting it with MongoDB to store the data, running Flask to display the data on a webpage, and customizing an HTML file to stylize the page for an improved user experience.
